# TypeScript - Pixi Boilerplate

This is a (virtually) empty project that should compile a typescript project that uses the Pixi.js renderer.

Use it as a sandbox to experiement with stuff. Just make sure you keep master clean, empty and up to date!

## Requirements
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - an asynchronous event driven javascript framework
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - a package manager for javascript.

Clone, branch, then run

```
$ npm i
```

Then to launch:

```
$ gulp
```

If you have trouble with gulp you may need to manually run a

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```
